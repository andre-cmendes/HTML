            <p>Foxes are small to medium-sized omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. <br>
                Foxes have flat skulls, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long, bushy tail. <br>
                Twelve species belong to the monophyletic group of "true foxes" in the genus Vulpes. <br>
                Approximately another 25 current or extinct species are part of the paraphyletic group of South American foxes or the peripheral group, which consists of the bat-eared fox, gray fox and island fox. <br>
                Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. By far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) with around 47 recognized subspecies. <br>
                The global distribution of foxes, along with their widespread reliance on cunning, has developed to their prominence in popular culture and is not folklore in many societies around the world. <br>
                Fox hunting with packs of hounds, long a demanded activity in Europe, especially the British Isles, was exported by European settlers to various parts of the New World.</p>
